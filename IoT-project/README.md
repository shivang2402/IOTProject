Using Arduino and Nodemcu(esp8266) We read temperature and humidity from DHT11 sensor with the help of ardunio uno and send that data to nodemcu with the help of serial communication by the help of Software Serial library and upload that data to firebase by the help of nodemcu.As a result we can see and upload current surrounding temperature at firebase.
